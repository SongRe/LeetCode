strategies
- using pointers to keep track of where things need to be placed in an array
    - RemoveElement, RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray as exmaples where we used a pointer that started at 0 and incremented when we put an element at the right spot
- Using pointers to fixate about a certain point, 
- Using pointers like a sliding window to change the window
- Using hashmaps and conditions to adjust said sliding window
- A lot of problems have what you're looking for reflected in the size of the sliding window (subarray less than product k, ...etc)
- Can have leading pointers and slow pointers
